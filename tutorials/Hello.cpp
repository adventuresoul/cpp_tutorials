// c++ uses a bottom up approach
// The bottom-up approach in C++ is a software development strategy that involves breaking down a complex system into smaller, more manageable components, and then building those components up into a larger, more comprehensive program. This approach can be contrasted with the top-down approach, which starts with a high-level view of the program and then works downwards to implement the individual components.

// At the heart of the bottom-up approach is the idea of modularization, which involves dividing a program into smaller, self-contained units that can be developed and tested independently of one another. Each module should have a well-defined interface that specifies how it interacts with other modules in the system, and it should be implemented in such a way that it can be reused in other programs or projects.
